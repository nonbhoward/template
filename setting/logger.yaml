#   to be set to an integer value representing the schema version.
#   The only valid value at present is 1, but having this key allows

version: 1

# filters -
#   the corresponding value will be a dict in which each key is a
#   filter id and each value is a dict describing how to configure the
#   corresponding Filter instance.
filters:
  # The configuring dict is searched for the key name (defaulting to the
  # empty string) and this is used to construct a logging.Filter instance.

    name: unfiltered

# formatters -
#   the corresponding value will be a dict in which each key is a
#   formatter id and each value is a dict describing how to configure
#   the corresponding Formatter instance.
formatters:
  # The configuring dict is searched for keys format and datefmt
  # (with defaults of None) and these are used to construct a
  # Formatter instance.
  # Changed in version 3.8: a validate key (with default of True) can
  # be added into the formatters section of the configuring dict, this
  # is to validate the format.

# handlers -
#   the corresponding value will be a dict in which each key is a

handlers:
  # The configuring dict is searched for the following keys:
  #   class (mandatory). This is the fully qualified name of the handler class.
  #   filters (optional). A list of ids of the filters for this handler.
  #   formatter (optional). The id of the formatter for this handler.
  #   level (optional). The level of the handler.
