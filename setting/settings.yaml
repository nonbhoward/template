  filters:
    # The configuring dict is searched for the key name (defaulting to the

  formatters:
    # The configuring dict is searched for keys format and datefmt
    # (with defaults of None) and these are used to construct a
    # Formatter instance.
    # Changed in version 3.8: a validate key (with default of True) can
